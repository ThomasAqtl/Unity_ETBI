# Unity_ETBI
Unity_ETBI (Eye-Tracking Based Interactions) is a school project in which I explore gaze-based interactions in VR with Unity.

## Prerequisites
Prefabs and scripts has been made to work in Unity version 2018.3.14f1. The VR headset used is the HTC Vive Pro Eye. External packages are needed and are detailed further.

## How to use

1. Install Unity. I recommend 2018.3.14f1 version to ensure everything works fine. Then creates a new empty 3D projetc.
2. Follow [Tobii's guide](https://vr.tobii.com/sdk/develop/unity/getting-started/vive-pro-eye/#step-3-download-and-import-the-vive-sranipal-sdk) to set your project with needed packages.
3. Import this repo's packages
